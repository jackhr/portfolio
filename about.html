    <h2 id="about">Born and raised on the island nation of Antigua & Barbuda in the heart of the Caribbean, Jack Fitzgerald Huntington-Rainey stems from a life of simplicity. Whether it’s dulcet tones he ushers forth during his musical gigs or developing code that seems to ‘cascade’ from his brain, Jack’s production is simple yet effective. A sudden and unexpected shift in the world's movements brought him to a new chapter in his life: coding. Having recently completed a 12 week long coding bootcamp at General Assembly, he now resides in the state of New York and remains committed to learning and more deeply understanding his now new love-craft that is coding.</h2>
